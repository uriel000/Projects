                    <p><span>Carol Susan Jane Danvers</span> is a former United States Air Force pilot who, upon being exposed to the energy of the Tesseract via the destruction of the Light-Speed Engine, obtained cosmic powers. She gained further powers when she was made into a Kree-human hybrid via a blood transfusion from Yon-Rogg, and had all of her old memories removed, turning her into the Kree's weapon and a member of Starforce. Now operating as Vers, she was captured by Skrulls during the Kree-Skrull War, resulting in her returning to Earth and beginning to recall her past, with help from Nick Fury and Maria Rambeau. Vers subsequently discovered that Yon-Rogg and the Kree Empire had been manipulating her for years, learning from Talos that the Skrulls were merely seeking to find a new home. With this information, Danvers, rejecting her Vers persona, unlocked her true powers and defeated the Kree invasion onto Earth that was being led by Ronan the Accuser, before setting off out to the far reaches of the galaxy to finish what her late mentor Mar-Vell had previously</p>
                    <p>Spending twenty-three years journeying through the universe, Captain Marvel learned of the Snap through the distress call sent out by Fury and had joined the Avengers in an attempt to confront Thanos and reverse the damage done, managing to also rescue Tony Stark and Nebula from deep space along the way. However, despite their first attempt at finding the Infinity Stones failing, Captain Marvel returned to Earth in 2023 when the Avengers had just succeeded with their second attempt to resurrect the victims of the Snap and assisted them during their fight against an alternate Thanos and his army. The combined efforts of Captain Marvel and her allies triumphed over Thanos and his forces, though Iron Man sacrificed his life, with Danvers attending his funeral before leaving Earth.</p>

                    <p>Carol Danvers was already in excellent shape before she was transformed by the Psyche-Magnitron. Afterwards, Carol’s body was pushed to the peak of human fitness and modified with Kree DNA. Her powers include enhanced strength, stamina, agility, and durability, as well as flight, and almost total immunity to toxins and poisons. Carol also has a “seventh sense” which gives her precognitive flashes of the future, but the power randomly manifests and has largely faded away.</p>
