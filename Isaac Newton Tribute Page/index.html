            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Born to a poor farming family in Woolsthorpe, England, in 1642, Isaac Newton arrived in the world only a few months after his father had died. "The boy expected to live managing the farm in the place of the father he had never known," wrote James Gleick in "Isaac Newton(opens in new tab)" (Vintage, 2004). However, when it became clear a farming life was not for him, Newton attended Trinity College in Cambridge, England. "He did not know what he wanted to be or do, but it was not tend sheep or follow the plough and the dung cart," wrote Gleick. While there, he took interest in mathematics(opens in new tab), optics, physics, and astronomy. After his graduation, he began to teach at the college, and was appointed as the second Lucasian Chair there. Today, the chair is considered the most renowned academic chair in the world, held by the likes of Charles Babbage and Stephen Hawking.</p>
            <p>In 1689, Newton was elected as a member of parliament for the university. In 1703, he was elected as president of the Royal Society, a fellowship of scientists that still exists today. He was knighted by Queen Anne in 1705. He never married.</p>
            <p>Sir Isaac Newton contributed significantly to the field of science over his lifetime. He invented calculus(opens in new tab) and provided a clear understanding of optics. But his most significant work had to do with forces, and specifically with the development of a universal law of gravitation and his laws of motion.</p>
            <p>Newton died in 1727, at the age of 84. After his death, his body was moved to a more prominent place in Westminster Abbey. During the exhumation, large amounts of mercury(opens in new tab) were found in the scientist's system, likely due to his work with alchemy, which appear to have had a detrimental affect on his health.</p>
